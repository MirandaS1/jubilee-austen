                    <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I've made my home base in Los Angeles, CA, with my family. My journey into tech started with a degree in film, which led me into numerous jobs in the entertainment industry. As I started learning about the technical side of the business, I was fascinated with learning more about building websites and coding - especially as a filmmaker, there are so many specifics with web building - like video and images - and I wanted to know how to do it all. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom and versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I do front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code and create websites for creative types in all professions.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p class="p2"> My focus is writing clean, well-formatted,
              semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure the content is easy
              to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot, and
              accessible.</p>

            <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
            <p class="p2"> I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy
            to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast
            to load, and I make a habit to stay up to date on current best
            practices. </p>

            <h3>Ease Converting Designs Into Code</h3>
            <p class="p2"> You can trust me to take a designer's PSD
            and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is
            a pixel-perfect match.</p>
